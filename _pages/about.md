I am a Master's student in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA Master), starting in september 2025. I completed my undergraduate studies at École nationale des ponts et chaussées in the Mathematics and Computer Science department.

My research interests focus on **flow matching**, **diffusion models**, and **large language models**. I have worked on machine learning engineering with Large Language Models during an internship at Sinequa, and conducted research on flow matching at Harvard University.

I am the first author of [Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342), published on arXiv in September 2025. Beyond this work, I am actively collaborating on three additional research projects currently in preparation, spanning image editing, 4D vision, and Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM).

You can find my code and projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaspardbd).
