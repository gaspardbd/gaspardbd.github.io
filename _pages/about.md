I am a Master's student in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA Master), starting in september 2025. I completed my undergraduate studies at École nationale des ponts et chaussées in the Mathematics and Computer Science department.

My research interests focus on **flow matching**, **diffusion models**, and **large language models**. I have worked on machine learning engineering with Large Language Models during an internship at Sinequa, more pricesely about training for agentic/tool calling abilities. I conducted research on flow matching at Harvard AI and Robotics Lab, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i9B02k4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: inherit;">Mengyu Wang</a>.

I am the first author of [Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342), published as a pre-print on arXiv in September 2025. I also co-authored [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/116281), recently accepted to NeurIPS 2025. Thanks to Minghan Li, Sung-Hoon Yoon, Jaeyon Kim and Mengyu Wang for for their incredible collaboration.

Beyond this work, I am actively collaborating on two additional research projects currently in preparation: 4D vision with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8S6_34oAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: inherit;">Kaichen Zhou</a>, and Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM) with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1bXthLsAAAAJ&hl=ko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: inherit;">Jaeyon Kim</a>.
